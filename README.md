###Stuff to ask Andy
1. Do we need a GUISettings Class?
2. GPS class has no variables - I am manually adding the x and y coordinates as an array
3. User class has no password
4. Where are we importing the libraries mentioned in the class diagram?
5. Class diagram shows no use of super classes to hold objects created by other classes, instead uses arrays. Will we be penalised for this?
6. UserRegister login function returns a user - what if the login credentials are wrong?
7. Should we use a seperate (new) coordinates class, because lots of classes use coordinates, and it would be neater to use standardised coordinates!!
8. There shouldnt be a list of fields in the main GUI - do we need a new class of ListOfFields?
